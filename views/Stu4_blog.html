			<h1>The Evolution of Cricket Balls</h1>

			Cricket is a sport that has been played for centuries and has undergone a significant transformation. One of
			the most significant changes has been the evolution of the cricket ball. The journey from traditional
			leather to pink, white, and red was not an easy one. It took years of experimentation to come up with a ball
			that could withstand the rigors of the game while also being easily visible to the players and the
			audience.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the early days of cricket, the ball was made of leather and stuffed with tightly packed cotton or
			horsehair. The ball was then stitched by hand and polished to a high shine to make it more aerodynamic.
			However, this ball had to be regularly oiled to maintain its shine, which also made it heavier and more
			difficult to grip.

			As cricket became a more popular sport, the need for a ball that was easier to see became apparent. This led
			to the development of the red cricket ball, which is still widely used today. The red ball is made from two
			pieces of leather stitched together, and the seam is raised to create friction when it is bowled. This
			allows the ball to swing and spin in the air, making it more challenging for the batsman to hit.
		</p>
		<p>
			In recent years, the game has seen the introduction of white and pink balls. The white ball is used in
			one-day and Twenty20 matches, while the pink ball is used in day-night test matches. These balls have been
			designed to make the game more visible to the audience, particularly those watching on television.

			The pink ball, in particular, is a significant innovation. It has been designed to be more visible in the
			floodlights and is easier to see than the traditional red ball. The pink ball also retains its shape and
			color for longer, making it more durable than the red ball.
		</p>
		<p>
			In conclusion, the evolution of cricket balls has been a fascinating journey. From traditional leather balls
			to the red, white, and pink balls, the game has continued to evolve. Today, cricket remains one of the most
			popular sports in the world, and its success is due, in part, to the constant innovation and development of
			the cricket ball.
